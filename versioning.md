APIs.io versioning is done using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), communicating major, minor, and patch changes. We are choosing to do versioning in the path to keep versioning simple for consumers, and spending more time thinking about how we change, to reduce breaking changes for our APIs.

You can stay in tune with changes via the change log and keep up to date with what is being planned via the road map. We communicate the version as part of the OpenAPI definition, and will always work to post a blog post and send out updates via social media when changes are released.
